- page completely reorganized
- results of OptalCP updated
- results of Hexaly on tai instances added
- references dominated have been removed

- different parameters used for OptalCP improve 309 lower bounds 8 upper bounds with respect to the best known solutions. Bounds found by previous parameters, when they are the best known, appear as `OptalCP_FFLL` or `OptalCP_FFBL`
- references of dominated bounds have been removed, mainly Gh2010 (16), vH2016 (13), SAH2015 (2), Ca2003 (1), Aa1996 (1)
- names of `vrf` instances have now leading zeros for them to be sorted properly by alphabetic sort
- attribution of `vrf` bounds was corrected to [VRF2015] instead of [NRR2022]
- made a greedy heuristic `DOFP2023` to show how bad engines the upper bounds of engines are on 1000 x 1000 instances
